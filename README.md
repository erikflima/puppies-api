### ‚öôÔ∏èHow to run the project

#### ‚úÖ Steps to Execute the Project Locally

 ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your computer.
Docker is required to run the project and its dependencies. If you don't have it installed, download and install Docker.

 ‚û°Ô∏è Step 2: Download the project.
 
   You can either clone the repository using Git or download the project as a ZIP file.
   
   To clone the repository:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

	  https://github.com/erikflima/puppies-api.git

   To download the ZIP file:
   Click the green Code button at the top of the repository and select Download ZIP. After downloading, extract the ZIP file to your preferred folder.
   
   
 ‚û°Ô∏è Step 3: Navigate to the project folder.
  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project. For example:

      cd path/to/project-folder
   
   
 ‚û°Ô∏è Step 4: Run the project using Docker.   
  
   Execute the following command to start the application:
   
      docker-compose up

   This command will create the necessary containers, including one for the Puppies API application and another for the database.
   The application will be up and running shortly after.
